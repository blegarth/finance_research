This program was built to aid in the research that Steve Warren 
and his professor at W&L University are doing. They reached out
to me to create a program that easily takes in data from multiple
different sites (Compustat, Wharton Stock Databases, and some other
W&L financial resources). My program takes all the data from multiple
txt and csv files and combines them to help in their research. If
needed I am happy to show demo this program with example data.
